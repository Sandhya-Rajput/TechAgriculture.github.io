                <p>
                    Agriculture  monitoring system is needed to reduce the need for human intervention in farming. This process is aimed to educate the farmer on the use of an integrated technology system to monitor the farm land to increase the quantity of the production of the crops. This project helps in  efficient usage of water. This project can also be used in various farm lands. It can be used in gardening, greenhouse farming, horticulture etc. In this project intruder can be detected by pir sensor farmer now no need to be afraid of theft of his crops and destruction of his crops by animals.

                    <li>	This system can be expanded in future while adding more sensors to make agriculture system more efficient.</li>
                <li>The sensor like help monitoring of soil and plant.</li>
                <li>To determine soil fertility etc</li>
                <li>To determine fire in crops.
